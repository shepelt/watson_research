# AI Development Rules for Watson

## Project Overview
Watson is a feasibility study exploring the integration of roll-up networks with enterprise blockchain technology, with a focus on Hyperledger Besu.

## Current Phase
**Research & Exploration** - No technology stack or project structure decided yet.

## Development Philosophy

### Research-First Approach
- **Document before implementing**: Write down hypotheses and expected outcomes
- **Test assumptions**: Each claim should be verifiable
- **Explore alternatives**: Consider multiple approaches before committing

### Start Simple, Grow Naturally
- Keep structure flat until needs emerge
- Don't create directories or frameworks until they're needed
- Let the research guide the architecture

### YAGNI Principle
- Only build what's needed to answer the current research question
- Don't create infrastructure before knowing what you're building
- Avoid premature technology decisions

### Code Modification Rules
- **NEVER modify files without explicit user permission**
  - Always show proposed changes first
  - Wait for user approval before applying
  - Exception: Only when user explicitly requests the change

## Key Research Questions
These will guide the project direction:
- What roll-up architecture fits enterprise blockchain needs?
- How does Besu's architecture support or hinder roll-up integration?
- What are the performance and security tradeoffs?
- What existing solutions or research can we build on?

## Documentation
- Keep research findings and decisions documented
- Document dead-ends and failures (they're learning material)
- Track feasibility metrics as they're identified

## Notes
This file will evolve as the project progresses and technology decisions are made.
